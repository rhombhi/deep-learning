    "Batch normalization is still a new enough idea that researchers are still discovering how best to use it. In general, people seem to agree to remove the layer's bias (because the batch normalization already has terms for scaling and shifting) and add batch normalization _before_ the layer's non-linear activation function. However, for some networks it will work well in other ways, too. \n",
